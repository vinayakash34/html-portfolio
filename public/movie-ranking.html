<h1>The Best Movies According to Vinay</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Bareilly Ki Barfi</h3>
<p>This is my favourite Bollywood Film. I love the acting of all the stars, especially Rajkumar Rao's acting. <br/>
    His every transition from a macho man to a highly innocent guy is so smooth and funny. This movie's dialogues are always to the context of the situation and well written.
</p>
<h3>Soorarai Pottru</h3>
<p>It's my source of energy and motivation, it's an inspiring and motivating film. Suriya Sir's has done justice to te character, he has lived that character to be honest. <br/> 
    It's wondeful film.

<h3>Dada</h3>
<p>A feel good movie.</p>
